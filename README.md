# amazon-sales

## Objective

The purpose of this project is to have a a general understanding of how products performed on Amazon's marketplace.

## Dataset

This dataset was retrieved from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karkavelrajaj/amazon-sales-dataset) and includes both quantitative and qualitative Amazon data, including product codes, product names, average product ratings, discount percentages, actual product prices, reviews and product descriptions.

## Findings 

It was found that the higher the discount on a product, the higher the average rating was as well. This may be due to customers feeling as though 
they gain better value from a marked down product versus paying full price. We see that as product discounts decrease, ratings do as well.
